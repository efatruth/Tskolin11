00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,520
THE FROZEN DEAD

2
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,160
Captain Servaz?

3
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,160
Yeah?

4
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,480
Hi, I'm Captain Ziegler,
head of the St. Martin detective squad.

5
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,880
Have you been briefed?

6
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,200
Not really.

7
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,720
Come, I'll show you.

8
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,320
May I?

9
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,600
It's up to you.

10
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,200
Do you know the area?

11
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,280
Yes, I do.

12
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,920
That's enough!

13
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You can't take it?

14
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,040
Thanks for coming
so soon, Martin.

15
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,320
Madam prosecutor.

16
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,360
That's the surprise?

17
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,960
I'm no good at presents.

18
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,480
-Can I borrow him for 2 minutes?
-Of course.

19
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,480
I'm sure it's a pain coming
all this way for a horse.

20
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,320
But I've got pressure from above.

21
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,600
Because of a horse?

22
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,720
No.

23
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,240
Because of the owner,
a certain Eric Lombard.

24
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,080
That animal was worth 600,000

25
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,000
and he owns one of the
biggest factories in the region.

26
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,800
He's not yet 40 but he's head
of a listed company.

27
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,440
Cathy, I'd rather you put
someone else on this job.

28
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,320
I don't want to get back into politics,

29
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,720
and I've got 3 homeless murdered
in Toulouse.

30
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,800
You know shit always rolls downhill.

31
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,680
It's very clear they want you
on the team.

32
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,920
There's nobody else?

33
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,720
Lombard knows powerful people.

34
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,520
They see you as a good detective.

35
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,000
Even if you don't believe that now.

36
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,280
Please Cathy, I don't want to be here.

37
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,320
Please.

38
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,000
Martin...

39
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,240
I don't want to tell them
you've refused.

40
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,160
Just an expert consultation
to start the investigation.

41
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,760
Two days, then I'm leaving.

42
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,840
It's good that you're here.

43
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,200
All the Intervention Brigade guys
are on a big drugs case.

44
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,520
We're not really used to twisted stuff.

45
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,960
I'm only here to give you a hand.
It's your case, Captain.

46
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,920
Aren't we too formal?

47
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,400
If you think so.

48
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,040
Listen, I don't understand...

49
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,760
You found the corpse at 7am.

50
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,480
Why did you only call
the police at 7.30?

51
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,520
I had to go down to find a signal.

52
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,360
OK.

53
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,440
So you discovered this thing,

54
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,920
you tried to call using
your mobile phone.

55
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,160
It didn't work, so you left.

56
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,000
-Correct.
-Why didn't you use the factory phone?

57
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,320
Dammit, I told you it wasn't us.

58
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,320
Find the sicko who did it
instead of hassling us.

59
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Sit down.

60
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,720
May I?

61
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,200
Could you stand up?

62
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,080
She told me to sit down.

63
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,200
Get up.

64
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,800
How much will I find
in your locker?

65
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,240
Louder, I can't hear you.

66
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,280
The cold mornings are tough.

67
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Sometimes we smoke a little joint.

68
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
That's why you hesitated
to call?

69
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
Go on, get out.

70
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,040
Get lost, I said.

71
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,080
Could you explain?

72
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,080
Can you explain?

73
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,000
To be quick and effective,
you must prioritise.

74
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,320
That guy isn't a priority.

75
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,080
How did it get up here?

76
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,320
We searched the cabin
but found nothing.

77
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,280
Where's the head?

78
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,680
Is there another way to get here
besides the cable car?

79
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,880
Yes.

80
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,520
There's a little road
behind the factory.

81
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Shall we go and have a look?

82
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Of course.

83
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,120
You should wear a parka.

84
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,240
Yeah.

85
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,320
-Where does this road go?
-Into the valley.

86
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,720
The Lombards own all this.

87
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,920
Well, Eric Lombard...
His parents are dead.

88
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,920
When did the son take over
the business?

89
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,440
Six months ago.
Not everyone's happy with it.

90
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,000
Why not?

91
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,880
The father knew his company
was important to the local economy,

92
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,720
and made sure everyone benefited.

93
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,920
It's not the same with his son.

94
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,960
He wants to clean up
"polluting regional industries"...

95
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,120
Not a bad idea.

96
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,440
No, but lots of people don't like it.

97
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,240
What the hell's that?

98
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,600
Got a torch?

99
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,640
Yes.

100
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,880
Here.

101
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,520
WARNIER PSYCHIATRIC UNIT

102
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,920
Trying to punish yourself again?

103
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,320
I can't be punished.

104
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,240
Why not?

105
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,760
When you're punished,
you start again.

106
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,680
And you can't start again?

107
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,480
You mean that nothing
can forgive your crime?

108
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,200
I had a dream last night.

109
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,200
A dream I hadn't had for years.

110
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,920
I dreamt...

111
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,400
I was cutting up my mother.

112
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,440
But everyone dreams, Francis.

113
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,160
-You don't have to...
-I won't be punished!

114
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,640
And your first victim...

115
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,920
Was he a priest, Francis?

116
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,840
Why him?

117
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,440
Why a priest?

118
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,480
Did you know him?

119
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,760
-Dr Ferney?
-Yes, Francis.

120
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,320
Tell her not to ask me again, please.

121
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,240
Dr Berg, let's leave Francis to rest.

122
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Right, Francis?

123
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,520
He refused to absolve your sins,
didn't he?

124
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,880
He'll never forgive me.

125
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,360
Who?

126
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,760
Who will never forgive you, Francis?

127
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
God?

128
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,640
It's secured.
They're waiting.

129
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,880
OK, I'll send 2 guys immediately.

130
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,560
Is this his head?

131
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Same colour.

132
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,280
Same mark. Seems likely.

133
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,160
We found this in the blood.

134
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,640
-What? A hair?
-Perhaps.

135
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,640
This is huge.

136
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,040
What have you got?

137
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,080
Not much.
He wasn't killed here.

138
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,600
Would a horse like that follow
a stranger without making a fuss?

139
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,240
That's what I wonder.

140
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,160
We started looking for
prints of feet, hooves, tyres...

141
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,080
But in such a busy place...

142
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,400
I've gathered the staff
so you can question them.

143
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,000
-Is Mr Lombard here?
-No, he's in London.

144
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,480
He'll be here as soon as he can.
Freedom was his favourite.

145
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,160
-Mr Lombard is very sad...
-Who used to ride this horse?

146
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,080
Nobody except Mr Lombard and Ben.

147
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,280
Ben?

148
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,160
Ben McFinley, the man
who looks after the horses.

149
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Is he here?

150
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,600
No. He's not feeling well,
he didn't want to join us.

151
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,680
Where can we find him?

152
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,040
-Mr McFinley?
-Yes?

153
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,360
Captain Servaz, from CRPJ Toulouse.
I've got a few questions about Freedom.

154
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,360
Go ahead.

155
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,880
When did you last see him?

156
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,160
Yesterday at 8.

157
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,600
-Where were you last night?
-I was out with a woman.

158
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,800
So she can confirm that?

159
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,520
I don't know, she's married.

160
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,000
Mr McFinley, could you get down
so we can talk properly?

161
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,160
Stop!

162
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,040
Aren't you on duty in Block C?

163
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,880
No, they're in activities now.

164
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,520
Already? Shit, I'm late.

165
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,320
You did well earlier with Imbert.

166
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,680
I mean it.

167
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,200
It's great he tolerated you so quickly,
but what you made him say... Wow!

168
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,000
So can I see the detainees in Block A?

169
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,120
That again?
You don't give up.

170
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,920
Don't worry, you'll be allowed.

171
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,760
But you've only been here 15 days
and even I had to wait several weeks.

172
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,080
-Elisabeth! We must work on the budget.
-Can't it wait?

173
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
No, it can't.

174
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,480
We'll talk about it later.

175
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,120
You're a killjoy, François!

176
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,440
I know, your patients
over my accounting.

177
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,480
Who knows what's logical...

178
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,560
If for whatever reason he really
held a grudge against his boss,

179
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,480
he'd attack him directly.

180
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,280
That guy really loves horses,
he wouldn't commit such butchery.

181
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,240
He did try to escape,
and he was armed.

182
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,000
When will they let you see him?

183
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,960
Excuse me, your room is ready.

184
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,200
Thanks.

185
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,120
I know I promised,
but I want to leave tonight.

186
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,080
What? You've got an interesting suspect,
a DNA analysis underway.

187
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,720
Ziegler's great,
she'll be fine on her own.

188
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,480
I'm going back to Toulouse,
I've got too much work there.

189
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,720
It's funny, I thought you'd
ask me if you could stay longer.

190
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,480
Let me go Cathy,
you know I'm tired.

191
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,120
He's been locked up for 10 years.
Thanks to you, he'll never be free.

192
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,240
He killed 6 people before I realised.

193
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Martin, Hirtmann tricked everyone,
not only you.

194
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,040
He was my daughter's godfather, Cathy.

195
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,080
How about me? He was my colleague
for almost 12 years.

196
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,960
I had lunch with him almost every day,
I saw him more than my husband.

197
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,000
We really were fooled, weren't we.

198
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,160
Pull yourself together.

199
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,160
You should
have been promoted years ago.

200
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,640
Draw a line under it
and move on.

201
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,320
Let me go Cathy.

202
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,800
Please.

203
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,600
You know, I've just understood.

204
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,240
For all these years,
I thought you felt guilty,

205
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,920
but actually you're afraid.

206
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,200
You're letting your fear take over,
Martin.

207
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,920
How much is that?

208
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,760
Hirtmann?

209
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,320
More origami?

210
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,320
It relaxes me, my friend.

211
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,400
Thanks.

212
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,800
She loved the elephant.

213
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
I used to sculpt.

214
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,880
Bring me wood and a knife,
and I'll make her a unicorn.

215
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,960
A knife? Really?

216
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,080
I guess that's a 'no'.

217
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,800
<i>How are you? Not too cold?</i>

218
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,560
How could I be cold after
those winters in Quebec?

219
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,560
<i>And how's your work?</i>

220
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,440
<i>You look tired.</i>

221
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,880
<i>Are they very difficult?</i>

222
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,760
Mum, they're disabled,
they're not aliens.

223
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,520
<i>Don't put words in my mouth.</i>

224
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,120
<i>But the other day, I saw a documentary</i>
<i>about a re-education centre like yours</i>

225
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,040
<i>and it looked tough, that's all.</i>

226
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,360
Well yeah it's tough,
but it's worse for them.

227
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,840
<i>I miss you, darling.</i>

228
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,600
I'd have loved to have Christmas
with you.

229
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,520
Yeah, me too.

230
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,000
Mum, I need to go.
I'll call you later.

231
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,240
<i>Good night.</i>

232
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,600
Yes?

233
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,200
Are you OK?
I heard a noise.

234
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,560
It's nothing, it's just my mirror...

235
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,120
-Shit.
-Show me.

236
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,680
No, no, it's fine, really.

237
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,640
-Show me.
-No, but it's nothing.

238
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,800
-Don't worry, I'll clean it...
-No, leave it Alex!

239
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,760
-Where's the antiseptic?
-I don't think I've got any.

240
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
It's OK, I've found it.

241
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,560
Sit down.

242
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,640
Hey, it's the first time
I've been in your room.

243
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,000
I hoped it'd be different.

244
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,720
You're being a pain.

245
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,640
OK. Did you feel it stinging?

246
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,920
-Here you are, miss.
-Thanks.

247
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,560
Want to tell me what happened?

248
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,600
Go on. I saw you
walk past the canteen.

249
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
You looked really angry.

250
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,280
No, it's Ferney.

251
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,240
She still won't let me
work with Block A patients.

252
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,560
Are they so different?

253
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
No, not really.

254
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,520
But it's you who has the files.

255
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,840
I'd like to be a mouse to observe them.

256
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,640
Who'd you visit first?

257
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,840
-Hirtmann?
-What do you think?

258
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,080
Of course.

259
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,400
-Is he so scary?
-No.

260
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,960
It's weird to think
he killed those girls.

261
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,480
-Can I ask you a favour?
-Yes.

262
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,400
My badge won't let me access Block A.

263
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,600
So I wanted to know...

264
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,880
if you'd lend me yours.

265
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,800
-You're not serious, Diane.
-It's just to see them.

266
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
You're crazy,
you want to get us fired?

267
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,240
Servaz.

268
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,480
<i>It's Irene. We've found a snow plough</i>
<i>covered in blood and hair.</i>

269
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,200
<i>It could be from our horse.</i>

270
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,160
-Where are you?
<i>-Downstairs.</i>

271
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
You left me alone last night.

272
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,160
I won't sleep here
while he's here.

273
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,840
Why not?

274
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,080
I work with him,
I don't want him seeing me in PJs.

275
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,680
There's always an excuse.

276
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,080
Morning.

277
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,200
Morning.

278
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,400
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

279
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,520
Bye.

280
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,800
Where's this snow plough?

281
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,600
Outside,
I came here in it.

282
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,920
The Forensic Team is taking care of it.

283
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,320
We're going straight to the owner's,
is that OK?

284
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
As long as we don't go in PJs.

285
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,200
What about the hair?

286
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,680
OK. Thanks Lucas,
call me when you know.

287
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,520
So?

288
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,760
No human traces this time. They found
animal blood and hair from Freedom.

289
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,760
Morning captain. Your guys warned me.
Come on in.

290
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,360
No, usually I'm at the garage.
Someone else takes care of the shop,

291
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,800
but her son's ill so
I'm working in the shop.

292
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,480
Is it just you at the garage
and vehicle hire?

293
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,120
My employee and apprentice
are on holiday this week.

294
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,120
That's why I was late
reporting the theft.

295
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,600
Have you seen
anything unusual?

296
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,960
No...

297
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,080
And I pay attention.

298
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,680
I've had a snowmobile stolen,
but I didn't expect a snow plough.

299
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,480
And then they used it for...

300
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,800
Well if you recall anything,
let us know.

301
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,360
That's just what you need.

302
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,960
It's from last year.
I'll give you a discount.

303
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,720
What? Do I look like a pumpkin?

304
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,960
No, more like a carrot.

305
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,040
Yeah, you enjoy mocking me.

306
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
You OK?

307
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,440
You must think I'm pathetic.

308
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,880
No, I've seen worse.

309
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,520
I never got used to the smell.

310
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,440
It would be odd if you did.

311
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,160
We already know
he died of a heart attack

312
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,920
due to an overdose of anaesthetics
or poison such as curare.

313
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,200
The decapitation occurred post mortem,

314
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,920
and given the state of the skin
and flesh, most likely with a chainsaw.

315
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,560
He was then butchered with
a hunter's or butcher's knife.

316
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,120
So anyone could have done it?

317
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,120
Yes. Any hunter accustomed
to butchering a wild boar or deer.

318
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,120
I'll be back.

319
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,960
No, darling, it'll be fine, I promise.

320
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,920
Eat with your mum tonight.

321
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,320
That'll make me happy, OK?

322
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,080
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

323
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,400
Stop worrying about me,
I'm your father not your son.

324
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,560
I'm going to Vincent and Charlene's.

325
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,920
I won't be alone.

326
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,720
<i>OK then.</i>

327
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,560
<i>I called the office and Vincent said</i>
<i>you were in Comminges.</i>

328
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,920
<i>Why didn't you say?</i>

329
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,560
Because I'll be back this evening.

330
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,280
-OK with you?
<i>-Where are you exactly?</i>

331
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,080
In St. Martin.

332
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,200
<i>Because of him?</i>

333
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,680
Of course not.

334
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,960
A horse was killed and as the owner's
a millionaire or billionaire,

335
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,680
we have to find the guy who
wanted to make lasagne.

336
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,840
<i>-Not funny, Dad.</i>
-I know.

337
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,320
Captain Servaz?

338
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,440
Got to go, sweetie.

339
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,720
<i>-Call me this evening.</i>
-I promise.

340
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,160
Raphaël Delaunay, local reporter
at the Courier.

341
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,240
I knew it wouldn't be long
before you showed up.

342
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,920
Better a decapitated horse
than a run-over dog, eh?

343
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,560
I'm happier to cover a case led by
the policeman who caught Hirtmann.

344
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,200
Check your information.
The case is led by Captain Ziegler.

345
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,760
Why are you here then?

346
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,920
Because he did military service
in the cavalry. Will that do?

347
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,280
Come on Raphaël, do us
a favour and let us work.

348
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,320
One question, Captain.

349
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,160
What's it like
being so close to Julian Hirtmann?

350
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,280
Goodbye.

351
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,360
The hospital called. McFinley's better.
We can question him.

352
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,160
Where's the guard?

353
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,320
Shit.

354
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,160
-McFinley?
-Wait.

355
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,560
-Captain!
-Where were you?

356
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,520
A doctor said there was
a brawl downstairs.

357
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,160
It was only 5 minutes.

358
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,680
No, no, don't move.

359
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,800
Bring him to me immediately
if he shows up, OK?

360
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,560
Nothing at Lombard's.

361
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,400
Well, we're sure the groom
is involved now.

362
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,080
Right, I'm off.

363
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,200
Go meet your daughter.
Send the report in two days.

364
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,520
I take you to the hostel.

365
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,200
-Happy Christmas.
-But it's yours!

366
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,000
Take it.

367
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,960
Well, it's goodbye then.

368
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,080
Go on.

369
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,440
Go on, you'll do great.

370
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,920
Happy Christmas.

371
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,040
Bye.

372
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,240
Francis Imbert was tortured
by his father,

373
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,160
always in front of his mother.

374
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,000
He needed a witness.

375
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,560
And as it was her who was tortured
before her son was born,

376
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,080
the poor woman let Francis
be abused instead.

377
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,200
I don't remember
seeing that in his file.

378
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,880
No, he only told me earlier.

379
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,840
But it's due to you, Diane.

380
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,880
You freed him from something.

381
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,160
-Aren't you going to ask?
-What?

382
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,920
To work with the patients in Block A.
You've been asking since the start.

383
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,400
You mean you accept?

384
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,880
I think it's time.

385
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Thanks.

386
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,400
Go on.

387
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,400
-Happy Christmas!
-Happy Christmas.

388
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,680
Very funny. It's lucky
some of us work, eh?

389
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,960
We're slackers, is that right?

390
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,360
A load of slackers.

391
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,520
Tell him, Vince.

392
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,640
Tell me what?

393
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,880
-We caught the murderers.
-No way.

394
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,960
-This afternoon.
-They're in custody?

395
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,200
You should have seen how
we screwed them.

396
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,920
It's you who'd have got screwed
if we hadn't been there!

397
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,080
Want to see them?

398
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,080
If you want to be Captain one day
you must understand...

399
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,080
you caught them, you deal with them!

400
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,720
Thank you Lord.

401
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,920
Is the boss in?

402
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,080
He's just left, he's cooking tonight.

403
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:32,440
Right then... Happy Christmas
you bunch of slackers!

404
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,240
Happy Christmas, Martin!

405
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,320
Martin! Where are you off to?

406
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,960
To see my daughter.

407
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,760
Maud called. She asked if
I'd really invited you round.

408
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,520
-What did you say?
-What do you think?

409
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,440
I'm tired. I didn't want to say
I was spending Christmas Eve in bed.

410
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,840
And why lie to me?

411
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,080
Because I don't want your pity either.

412
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,800
OK, come and have dinner with us.
We've got enough food for a year.

413
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,200
Vincent...

414
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,800
Small ball... Number 11.

415
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,440
Oh yes!

416
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,360
Number 12... A 12?

417
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,960
12? No 12?

418
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,680
It turns again, it turns...

419
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,320
-What fun!
-Yeah!

420
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,720
73! 73? 73?

421
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,000
-73! Pierre! Come get your prize!
-Great Christmas Eve, huh?

422
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,000
Two years of this.

423
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,440
Let's check first.

424
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800
I want to have kids
so I get holidays off.

425
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,960
It's your lucky day!
Show me.

426
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,080
I need a fag or I'll go mad.
You coming?

427
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,080
How great!

428
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,920
Bravo Pierre, happy Christmas!

429
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,840
Happy Christmas, Pierre!

430
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,040
-We haven't clapped for Pierre!
-Let's clap nice and loud!

431
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,800
Pierre, happy Christmas!

432
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,400
-Shall we continue?
-Let's!

433
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,200
-Why did you come to work here?
-How so?

434
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,920
I don't know. You come from Montreal,
you don't know anyone in the region.

435
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,000
All to spend time with guys who
make Jack the Ripper look cute.

436
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,240
So why are you here?

437
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,680
Hey, you've been answering my questions
with another question since you arrived.

438
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,640
What do you want me to say?

439
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,680
I was fed up with Canada.

440
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,560
And to answer,

441
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,560
you don't hesitate when given the chance
to work at a centre like Warnier.

442
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,840
So why do you work here?

443
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,720
Around here there's not much choice.
Old people, or psychiatrics.

444
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,600
I was sick
of dealing with old people.

445
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,360
I'm going inside, I'm freezing.

446
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,560
Have you finished?

447
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,720
What's your problem, Diane?

448
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,840
If you don't fancy me, why flirt?

449
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,680
You're allowed to look.

450
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,480
She's beautiful.

451
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,240
Fuck! Is it me
or is the room spinning?

452
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,600
I've drunk too much too,
I'm going to head off.

453
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,600
Bye, old man.
Thanks.

454
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,520
Yeah, happy Christmas.

455
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,800
Martin?

456
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,800
Why did you come?

457
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,640
He invited me.
I know I shouldn't have come.

458
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,240
I won't anymore.

459
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,560
I'm pregnant.

460
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,440
Since when?

461
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,720
Since the last time.
3 months ago.

462
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,160
Does Vincent know?

463
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,080
What will you do?

464
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,240
Martin, it's his child.

465
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
Not yours.

466
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,160
You hear me?

467
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,880
Be careful driving home.

468
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,320
<i>Martin?</i>

469
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,160
Irene.

470
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,600
<i>The hair we found by the horse's head...</i>

471
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,960
<i>It's Hirtmann's.</i>

472
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,400
<i>Martin?</i>

473
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,800
I'll call you back.
